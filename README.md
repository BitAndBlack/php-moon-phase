# Solaris PHP Moon Phase

Calculate the phases of the Moon in PHP. This library is based on [Moontool for Windows](http://www.fourmilab.ch/moontoolw/).

## Installation

This library is made for the use with [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/solaris/php-moon-phase). Add it to your project by running `$ composer require solaris/php-moon-phase`.

## Usage

Create an instance of the `MoonPhase` class, supplying a `DateTime` object with a UNIX timestamp for when you want to determine the moon phase (if you don't then the current time will be used). 

You can then use the following methods:

-   `getPhase()`: the terminator phase angle as a fraction of a full circle (i.e., `0` to `1`). Both `0` and `1` correspond to a New Moon, and `0.5` corresponds to a Full Moon.
-   `getIllumination()`: the illuminated fraction of the Moon (`0` = New, `1` = Full).
-   `getAge()`: the age of the Moon, in days.
-   `getDistance()`: the distance of the Moon from the centre of the Earth (kilometres).
-   `getDiameter()`: the angular diameter subtended by the Moon as seen by an observer at the centre of the Earth (degrees).
-   `getSunDistance()`: the distance to the Sun (kilometres).
-   `getSunDiameter()`: the angular diameter subtended by the Sun as seen by an observer at the centre of the Earth (degrees).
-   `getPhaseNewMoon()`: the time of the New Moon in the current lunar cycle, i.e., the start of the current cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseNextNewMoon())`: the time of the New Moon in the next lunar cycle, i.e., the start of the next cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseFullMoon()`: the time of the Full Moon in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseNextFullMoon()`: the time of the Full Moon in the next lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseFirstQuarter()`: the time of the first quarter in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseNextFirstQuarter()`: the time of the first quarter in the next lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseLastQuarter()`: the time of the last quarter in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseNextLastQuarter()`: the time of the last quarter in the next lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
-   `getPhaseName()`: the [phase name](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/moon_phases.php).

### Example

```php
<?php

use Solaris\MoonPhase;

$moonPhase = new MoonPhase();

$age = round($moonPhase->getAge(), 1);
$stage = $moonPhase->getPhase() < 0.5 ? 'waxing' : 'waning';
$distance = round($moonPhase->getDistance(), 2);
$next = gmdate('G:i:s, j M Y', (int) $moonPhase->getPhaseNextNewMoon());

echo 'The moon is currently ' . $age . ' days old, and is therefore ' . $stage . '. ';
echo 'It is ' . $distance . ' km from the centre of the Earth. ';
echo 'The next new moon is at ' . $next . '. ';
```
